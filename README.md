This is a part of the [unified COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19_Unified-Dataset) to provide epidemiological estimates of infections and effective reproduction number.

The estimates are generated using [`EpiNow2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EpiNow2) and [`EpiEstim`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EpiEstim) R packages. The parameters required for Rt estimates, specifically the distributions of incubation period and serial interval, are obtained from the literature.

	abstract = {An impressive number of COVID-19 data catalogs exist. None, however, are optimized for data science applications, e.g., inconsistent naming and data conventions, uneven quality control, and lack of alignment between disease data and potential predictors pose barriers to robust modeling and analysis. To address this gap, we generated a unified dataset that integrates and implements quality checks of the data from numerous leading sources of COVID-19 epidemiological and environmental data. We use a globally consistent hierarchy of administrative units to facilitate analysis within and across countries. The dataset applies this unified hierarchy to align COVID-19 case data with a number of other data types relevant to understanding and predicting COVID-19 risk, including hydrometeorological data, air quality, information on COVID-19 control policies, and key demographic characteristics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by NASA Health \&amp; Air Quality project 80NSSC18K0327, under a COVID-19 supplement, National Institute of Health (NIH) project 3U19AI135995-03S1 ("Consortium for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB)"; Collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute and UCLA), and NASA grant 80NSSC20K1122.
